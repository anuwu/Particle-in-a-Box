# Particle-in-a-Box

![title](Docs/schrodinger.png)

Solving Schrodinger's Equation with a Neural Network using numerical integration and automatic differentiation. The steps to run the python [notebook](kitchin.ipynb) is self-explanatory. All input variables are accepted as forms in the Google Colab notebook.


The neural network is successfully able to solve the Particle-in-a-Box potential for the first few eigen-energies and even upto the fifth eigen-energy.
