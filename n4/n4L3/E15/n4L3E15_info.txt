100*(1 - prob)**2 + 1000/prob + 250*(prob**4)
Had initially started with the target of achieving n=5 value. However, prob reached 1 very quickly because the weight of the diffeq term was small
in compare to the prob regularisation terms in the loss function. A balacne between the two terms need to be maintained.
